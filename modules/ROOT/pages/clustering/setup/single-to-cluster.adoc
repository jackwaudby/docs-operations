= Move from single to cluster

This is an example of how to move from a single Neo4j server to a Neo4j cluster. 

== Before you begin
. Ensure that the single server is stopped. 

== Migration steps 
. On the single server add `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` to `neo4j.conf`.
. Setup the others server and configure them as per xref:clustering/setup/deploy.adoc[Configure a cluster with three servers].
. On the single server dump the `system` database using `neo4j-admin database dump`.
. For each other server use `neo4j-admin database load system` to load the system database from the single server.
. Start all servers
. Using `SHOW SERVERS` verify that all new servers are in the `Free` state. 
. Using `SHOW DATABASES` verify that all user databases are still running on the original server.
. Enable each new server using `ENABLE SERVER`.
. You can then scale up user databases using `ALTER DATABASE`.
